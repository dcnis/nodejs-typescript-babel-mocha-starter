## For development
This command will use nodemon to spin up the application with hot reloading.
```
npm run start
```

## In production
We can use ```npm run build``` for pre-compiling our assets, and ```npm run serve``` for starting our server in production.
This means we can quickly restart our server without waiting for babel to recompile our files.
```
npm run build
npm runs serve
```


## Run tests
This command will run mocha tests.
```
npm run test
```
